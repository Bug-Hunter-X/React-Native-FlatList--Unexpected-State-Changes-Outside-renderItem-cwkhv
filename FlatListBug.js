This error occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native and you attempt to render a component that modifies the state outside of the `renderItem` method.  React Native's `FlatList` optimizes rendering by reusing components, and if you try to change state directly in a `keyExtractor` function or other methods outside the rendering scope, it can lead to unpredictable behavior and incorrect updates. The component might not update as expected or you might see race conditions.
